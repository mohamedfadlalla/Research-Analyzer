      "\n",
      "Purpose of Review This article provides a review of the recent literature related to the FDA-approved drugs that had been repurposed as potential drug candidates against COVID-19. Moreover, we performed a quality pharmacophore study for frequently studied targets, namely, the main protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and spike protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent Findings Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic, the whole spectrum of scientifc community is still unable to invent an absolute therapeutic agent for COVID-19. Considering such a fact, drug repurposing strategies seem a truly viable approach to develop novel therapeutic interventions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summery Drug repurposing explores previously approved drugs of known safety and pharmacokinetics profle for possible new efects, reducing the cost, time, and predicting prospective side efects and drug interactions. COVID-19 virulent machinery appeared similar to other viruses, making antiviral agents widely repurposed in pursuit for curative candidates. Our main protease pharmacophoric study revealed multiple features and could be a probable starting point for upcoming research.\n",

      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards the end of 2019, a novel beta coronavirus was identifed as the causative agent of huge cases of unprecedented pneumonia, reported for the frst time in Wuhan city, China. Soon after, the WHO labeled the severe acute respiratory This article is part of the Topical Collection on *Nanodrugs*\n",
      "* Bashir A. Yousef bashiralsiddiq@gmail.com 1 Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Khartoum, Al-Qasr Ave, Khartoum 11111, Sudan 2 Department of Analytical Chemistry, Central Laboratory, Ministry of Higher Education and Scientifc Research, Khartoum, Sudan 3 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Sudan University of Science and Technology, Khartoum, Sudan 4 Department of Molecular Biology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Bahri, Khartoum, Sudan syndrome as COVID-19 and the virus as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1, 2]. \n",
      "\n",
      "Starting on March 2020, the WHO announced that COVID19 has become a global pandemic [3]. The pandemic afected the whole world, [1, 4], and due to its airborne infectivity, social distancing measures have been imposed by international authorities [5].\n",
      "\n",
      "As a response to the sudden outbreak of COVID-19, an intensive global research eforts have been devoted to investigate potential therapeutic approaches. Looking at the fast return and the low cost of drug repurposing strategies, it has been implemented as immediate drug discovery pipeline [6â€¢]. Many clinically useful drugs including aspirin and sildenafl which were originally used as infammation and hypertension have been successfully repurposed for cardiovascular diseases and erectile dysfunction, respectively [7, 8]. Nowadays, molecular docking as an in silico method is very popular in drug discovery researches, because of its ability to illustrate the interactions between the ligand and its biological targets [8, 9]. Pharmacophore modeling - defned as a set of molecular features that enable biologically active ligands to exert a pharmacological efect - practice is widely used in the drug discovery process [10]. Herein, we reviewed and summarized research of FDA-approved drugs repurposed against SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Methods Workfow Search Strategy\n",
      "\n",
      "During the period of COVID-19, the scientifc community had published an immense number of studies about repurposing drugs for COVID-19. These studies are scattered on the internet, and no one database will be inclusive enough to all of these studies, aside from Google Scholar. All studies have been collected by the end of 2020/12/30. In order to achieve an efcient search strategy, the following combinations of keywords were applied during the research in the Google Scholar database: (COVID19 OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (Drug repurposing OR Drug repositioning OR Drug re-profling OR Drug rediscovery) AND (Docking AND Molecular dynamic).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Data Selection And Extraction\n",
      "\n",
      "Titles and abstracts were frst checked for eligibility using specifc inclusion and exclusion criteria (Table 1). Selected paper were then completely reviewed as a second stage, while articles that met the exclusion criteria were eliminated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Primarily, searching revealed a total of 405 articles, after applying the above mentioned criteria above, we ended up with 92 research articles, as presented in the fow diagram \n",
      "(Fig. 1). We further classifed them according to SARSCoV-2 targets: 73 for the main protease, 11 for spike protein, and 8 for replicase complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Pharmacophore Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "To perform the pharmacophore study, we had to ensure that all the drugs analyzed bind to the same site on the target. Thus, we classifed the drug within the same target according to the binding site. There are various approaches used in literature to defne the binding site or the docking site. Nevertheless, we obtained one binding site for each target except the main protease; it gave us two binding sites. Phase from Schrodinger suits was used to generate the pharmacophore hypothesis [11]. As the quality of the pharmacophore was our biggest concern, we used the number of features and the Hyposcore as a measure of quality. The following criteria were implemented: a maximum of 7 features, a minimum of 6 features, and minimum coverage of 50% of the compounds at the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Data Description\n",
      "\n",
      "In silico work on COVID-19, drug discovery started even before the PDB structure of SARS-CoV-2 targets was released; during that time, homology modeling was used to generate the protein structure in question. The generated targets that have been investigated are spike protein, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), main protease, helicase, and papain-like protease. However, from them, we reviewed only the most studied targets (main protease, spike protein, and RdRp) [1, 2].\n",
      "\n",
      "All papers follow a similar protocol, as shown in Fig. 2a either docking alone or docking and molecular dynamics simulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "As illustrated in Fig. 2b, the most used software for molecular docking was Autodock vina, followed by Glide and preceded by Autodock 4. The open source feature of Autodock rationalizes its greatest usage frequency. Autodock vina is the most used because it is easier to use compare to Autodock4, and it has have been implemented in many software packages like PyRx. In addition, Autodock vina is faster and more accurate depending on the system and the parameter setting [12].\n",
      "\n",
      "While docking studies consider the flexibility of the ligand as a rigid structure, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation takes the ligandâ€“protein complex as a dynamic module. It searches the conformational space for the most stable conformation, giving more accurate results. Moreover, due to the cost of running MD simulation, only 48 studies out of 89 confrmed docking results with MD (Fig. 2a). GROMACS \n",

      "\n",
      "The fact that no human protease mimics the cleavage activity of the viral main protease; it has been a well-positioned drug target [13â€¢â€¢]. The sequence identity shows that 96% of SARS-CoV-2 main protease is identical with other SARSCOV viruses [14]. This high conservation encourages researchers to study inhibitors and other drugs for repurposing them against SARS-COV-2 main protease. Yang's group was the frst group to release the crystal structure of the main protease (PDB ID: 6LU7) [15]. In this paper, we classifed the drugs according to the anatomical therapeutic chemical classifcation system (Table 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "Anti-infective agents were the most frequent class, with antivirals and tetracycline being the predominant subclasses; thus, they have been considered in the discussion. The following most frequent classes are the antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents (Table 2). \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Antivirals\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the 29 antiviral drugs that were reported to bind with the viral main protease, 16 drugs are already protease inhibitors; hence, the hypothesis here is whether they are SARS-COV-2 protease inhibitors too. These drugs are indinavir, ritonavir, lopinavir, nelfnavir, saquinavir, simeprevir, paritaprevir, darunavir, atazanavir, glecaprevir, telaprevir, tipreanavir, brecanavir, grazoprevir, tipranavir, and amprenavir. Furthermore, they work on only two proteases, human immunodefciency virus type 1 protease and NS3/4A protein. Of these compounds, indinavir was reported eight times with seven diferent docking software, ritonavir was repeated twelve times with seven diferent docking software, and fnally, lopinavir was repeated eleven times with seven diferent docking software. All these evidences support their potential as drugs for COVID-19. On the other hand, asunaprevir, ciluprevir, and pleconaril work on \"Genome polyprotein,\" a complex protein with many functions including protease activity, and they could be considered for further analysis. \n",
      "\n",
      "![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the other ten drugs have diverse targets, and they failed pharmacophore analysis, so we excluded them in pharmacophore analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Tetracyclines\n",
      "\n",
      "Another class of compounds that peaked our interest is the tetracyclines; we found that five tetracyclines in the literature claim to have inhibitory activities against the main protease. These compounds are oxytetracycline, lymecycline, tetracycline, minocycline, and doxycycline. Tetracyclines are broad-spectrum antibiotics, and they have the general structure of four fused rings. They work by inhibiting protein synthesis; notably, they inhibit the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA translation complex [89].\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Pharmacophore Analysis Of The Main Protease\n",
      "\n",
      "Most studies on the main protease have been conducted on the 6LU7 structure, and all of those studies performed their docking analysis on two binding sites. One has cysteine-type endopeptidase activity (CYS145), and the other is a larger protein cavity. It is worth noting that our pharmacophore studies only conducted on the cysteine type, as replicating such analysis has failed on the second one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CYS145 was the most studied binding site in 85% \n",
      "of all the studies that used the PDB 6LU7. The number of drugs for this binding site was huge, putting pressure on the phase alignment algorithm. We had to create pharmacophore modules for the predominant classes of drugs, including antivirals, tetracyclines, antineoplastics, immunomodulating, and all combined drugs. As described in the workfow, we used strict parameters, and only tetracyclines and antivirals had survived. For comparison purposes, we included the N3 complexed inhibitor and the binding site hypothesis. We studied quality, type of features, and features alignment for these pharmacophores (Table 3, Fig. 3a).\n",
      "\n",
      "N3 is a co-crystallized inhibitor with 6LU7; its pharmacophore is rich in hydrogen donor features, which is expected because it is a polypeptide, subsequently containing alternating hydrogen bond donor and hydrogen bond acceptor. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tetracycline is also rich in hydrogen donor features, and the antivirals pharmacophore is rich in hydrogen acceptors. The pharmacophore search of antivirals having an anti-protease activity - as its original mechanism of action - was successful with 6 features and a Hyposcore of 1.09 (Table 3). \n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, the search for pharmacophores of the other antivirals, where-the original mechanism of action is not anti-protease, had failed due to our strict parameters. These hypotheses contain at least one aromatic ring, and the negative charge feature is only present on the binding site.\n",
      "\n",

Pharmacophores have to agree on the location of the features concerning each other, so how do these hypotheses align to each other? They align with at least 3 matches, except N3 inhibitor and tetracycline aligned with 4 matched features. Considering this, we concluded our search for pharmacophores with four hypotheses, and we emphasized the overlapping features of N3 and tetracycline; 2 hydrogen bond donors, 1 hydrogen bond acceptor, and 1 aromatic ring (Fig. 3a).\n",
