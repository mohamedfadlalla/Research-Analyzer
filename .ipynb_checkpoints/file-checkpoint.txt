Overall, the paper proposes a novel solution to the problem of identifying relevant studies on drug repurposing for COVID-19, and its contribution to the field lies in its systematic and efficient approach to literature search.## Discussion

While the study presents a comprehensive search strategy to identify relevant studies on drug repurposing for COVID-19, there are several limitations and potential biases that could affect the results and their generalization.

Firstly, the reliance on Google Scholar as the primary database may introduce bias, as it is not a comprehensive database of all scientific literature. Other databases, such as PubMed or Scopus, may have included studies that were not captured in Google Scholar. This could lead to an incomplete picture of the existing literature on drug repurposing for COVID-19.

Secondly, the search strategy used a combination of keywords, which may not have captured all relevant studies. The use of synonyms (e.g., "Drug repurposing" and "Drug repositioning") may have helped to increase the sensitivity of the search, but it is possible that some studies may have been missed due to variations in terminology.

Thirdly, the search was limited to studies published by the end of 2020/12/30, which may not reflect the current state of knowledge on drug repurposing for COVID-19. Studies published after this date may have included new findings or methodologies that could have impacted the results.

Lastly, the study did not provide information on the quality assessment of the included studies, which is an important consideration when evaluating the validity of the results. The inclusion of low-quality studies could have introduced bias and affected the generalizability of the findings.

In conclusion, while the study presents a thorough search strategy, there are several limitations and potential biases that should be considered when interpreting the results. Future studies should aim to address these limitations by using more comprehensive databases, incorporating more nuanced search strategies, and providing a thorough quality assessment of the included studies.The researchers conclude that drug repurposing using molecular docking and other in silico drug discovery approaches holds promise in the fight against COVID-19. They found that antiviral drugs, particularly those targeting the main protease, show potential in inhibiting viral replication. The study suggests that tetracyclines and antivirals, originally protease inhibitors, may be effective therapeutic agents against COVID-19. The researchers recommend using the models developed in this study for further research, including virtual screening, to aid in the discovery of effective therapeutic agents against COVID-19.Here are some significant studies cited in the paper that are crucial for understanding the context or further exploration:
