       "### Results\n",
       "\n",
       "The review identified several studies that have used molecular docking to identify potential therapeutic agents against COVID-19. The results showed that molecular docking can be a valuable tool in the discovery of new therapeutic agents.\n",

       "\n",
       "### Purpose\n",
       "The purpose of this review is to summarize the recent literature on FDA-approved drugs that have been repurposed as potential candidates against COVID-19. The study also includes a quality pharmacophore analysis of frequently studied targets, including the main protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and spike protein.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Recent Findings\n",
       "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for effective therapeutic agents. Despite ongoing research, no absolute therapeutic agent has been developed. Drug repurposing strategies offer a viable approach to develop novel therapeutic interventions.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Drug Repurposing\n",
       "Drug repurposing involves exploring previously approved drugs with known safety and pharmacokinetic profiles for new effects, reducing costs, time, and predicting potential side effects and drug interactions. The COVID-19 viral machinery shares similarities with other viruses, making antiviral agents widely repurposed in the search for curative candidates.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Pharmacophore Analysis\n",
       "The main protease pharmacophoric study revealed multiple features, providing a starting point for future research.\n",

       "**Introduction**\n",
       "---------------\n",
       "\n",
       "In late 2019, a novel beta coronavirus was identified as the cause of severe pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization (WHO) labeled the disease as COVID-19 and the virus as SARS-CoV-2.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Global Pandemic**\n",
       "-----------------\n",
       "\n",
       "By March 2020, the WHO announced that COVID-19 had become a global pandemic, affecting the entire world. Due to its airborne infectivity, social distancing measures were imposed by international authorities.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Drug Repurposing**\n",
       "-----------------\n",
       "\n",
       "In response to the sudden outbreak, global research efforts focused on investigating potential therapeutic approaches. Drug repurposing strategies were implemented as an immediate drug discovery pipeline. Clinically useful drugs, such as aspirin and sildenafil, were successfully repurposed for cardiovascular diseases and erectile dysfunction, respectively.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In Silico Methods**\n",
       "-------------------\n",
       "\n",
       "Molecular docking and pharmacophore modeling are popular in silico methods used in drug discovery research. Molecular docking illustrates interactions between ligands and biological targets, while pharmacophore modeling identifies molecular features that enable biologically active ligands to exert a pharmacological effect.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Research Summary**\n",
       "-------------------\n",
       "\n",
       "This article reviews and summarizes research on FDA-approved drugs repurposed against SARS-CoV-2 virus. **Methods Workflow Search Strategy**\n",
       "===============================\n",
       "\n",
       "### Background\n",
       "During the COVID-19 pandemic, the scientific community published a vast number of studies on repurposing drugs for COVID-19. These studies are scattered across the internet, making it challenging to find a comprehensive database that includes all of them, aside from Google Scholar.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Search Strategy\n",
       "To achieve an efficient search strategy, the following combinations of keywords were applied during the research in the Google Scholar database:\n",
       "\n",
       "* `(COVID19 OR SARS-CoV-2)` to capture studies related to COVID-19\n",
       "* `(Drug repurposing OR Drug repositioning OR Drug re-profiling OR Drug rediscovery)` to focus on studies about repurposing drugs\n",
       "* `(Docking AND Molecular dynamic)` to narrow down the search to studies that involve docking and molecular dynamics\n",
       "\n",
       "### Search Parameters\n",
       "The search was conducted up to December 30, 2020, to ensure that all relevant studies were included. **Data Selection And Extraction**\n",
       "=============================\n",
       "\n",
       "### Methodology\n",
       "\n",
       "* Titles and abstracts were reviewed for eligibility using specific inclusion and exclusion criteria (Table 1)\n",
       "* Selected papers were further reviewed in a second stage, while articles that met the exclusion criteria were eliminated\n",
       "\n",
       "### Search Results\n",
       "-----------------\n",
       "\n",
       "* Initial search yielded 405 articles\n",
       "* After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 92 research articles were selected\n",

       "\n",
       "### Overview\n",
       "\n",
       "RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a replicase that synthesizes a complementary RNA strand using RNA as a template. The SARS-CoV-2 RdRp is composed of 932 amino acids, divided into the N-terminal and polymerase domains.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Structure\n",
       "\n",
       "The RdRp protein is structured into three subunits: the finger, palm, and thumb. The active site is located in the middle of the substrate domain, where RNA synthesis occurs.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Function\n",
       "\n",
       "The RdRp enzyme synthesizes RNA by accessing an RNA template from the template input channel and nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) from the NTP input channel.\n",

       "\n",
       "A review of literature revealed several papers discussing Nsp12, a key enzyme in the SARS-CoV-2 replication process. The study focused on antiviral agents that target the polymerase, as well as antineoplastic agents with potential inhibitory effects.\n",

       "### Remdesivir\n",
       "\n",
       "Remdesivir is a nucleoside analog that has been extensively studied in vitro and in silico. It is incorporated into the growing viral RNA, terminating RNA replication. Remdesivir has high affinity for the active site of RdRp, competing with natural substrates and getting incorporated into the RNA chain. It has been investigated in multiple COVID-19 clinical trials and has received FDA Emergency Use Authorization for COVID-19 treatment.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Other Reported Drugs\n",

       "\n",
       "### Structure\n",
       "\n",
       "The spike protein consists of two subunits, S1 and S2. The S1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that binds and recognizes the ACE2 receptor, while the S2 subunit mediates viral cell membrane fusion.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Function\n",
       "\n",
       "The spike protein uses the ACE-2 receptor for entry to the host cell. It is coated with polysaccharide molecules to evade the surveillance of the host immune system during entry. Targeting the spike protein can potentially decrease the chance of infection by preventing viral invasion to host cells.\n",

       "### Repurposed Drugs\n",
       "\n",
       "Research has been conducted to identify the role of repurposed drugs on spike proteins and ACE2. Table 4 lists drugs that target RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, while Table 5 classifies studies that interrupt the COVID-19 mechanism of entry into three classes:\n",
