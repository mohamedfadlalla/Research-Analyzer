       "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has become a global health crisis. The study aims to investigate the potential of repurposing FDA-approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2 virus using molecular docking and pharmacophore modeling.\n",
       "##  Methods                     \n",
       "**Methodology Summary:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* Design: Systematic search of scientific studies on Google Scholar\n",
       "* Sample: All studies published by the end of 2020/12/30\n",
       "* Tools/Techniques: \n",
       "  - Keywords: (COVID19 OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (Drug repurposing OR Drug repositioning OR Drug re-profling OR Drug rediscovery) AND (Docking AND Molecular dynamic)\n",
       "  - Database: Google Scholar\n",
       "##  Main Findings               \n",
       "* 1,444 studies on repurposing drugs for COVID-19 were collected from Google Scholar by the end of 2020/12/30.\n",
       "##  Analysis and Interpretation \n",
       "The authors used a systematic search strategy in Google Scholar to collect studies on drug repurposing for COVID-19, using a combination of keywords. The search was limited to studies published by the end of 2020/12/30.\n",
       "\n",
       "The authors did not mention any specific statistical methods used in the analysis. However, the results of the search strategy are likely to be presented in the form of a list of studies, which may be analyzed using descriptive statistics (e.g., frequency, percentage) to summarize the findings.\n",
       "\n",
       "The implications of the results are not explicitly stated, but the authors likely aim to provide an overview of the existing literature on drug repurposing for COVID-19, which can inform future research and clinical decisions.\n",
       "##  Contributions and Novelty   \n",
       "The paper contributes to the field of COVID-19 research by providing a comprehensive search strategy for identifying studies on repurposing drugs for COVID-19. The novel approach proposed is the use of a combination of keywords in the Google Scholar database to efficiently collect relevant studies.\n",
       "##  Limitations                 \n",
       "The study may be limited by the reliance on Google Scholar, which may not be comprehensive in capturing all relevant studies, particularly those published in non-English languages or in non-indexed journals. Additionally, the search strategy may be biased towards studies that used docking and molecular dynamics, potentially overlooking other repurposing methods.\n",
       "##  Conclusions and Recommendations \n",
       "The researchers conclude that antiviral drugs, particularly those targeting the main protease, show promise in the fight against COVID-19. Tetracyclines and antivirals, originally protease inhibitors, are recommended for further investigation. The models developed in this study can be used for virtual screening to aid in finding effective therapeutic agents against COVID-19.\n",

       "\n",
       "- **Detailed Findings**:\n",
       "  - **Procedure Descriptions**: The method section does not provide detailed descriptions of the procedures used. For example, it mentions using PocketMatch to test the similarity of approved drugs' binding sites against all of the binding sites found on SARS CoV2 proteins, but it does not explain how PocketMatch was used, what parameters were set, or how the results were interpreted. Similarly, the docking process is mentioned, but the specifics of the docking protocol, such as the software used, parameters, and how the results were validated, are not provided.\n",
       "  - **Materials and Equipment**: The method section does not list the necessary materials and equipment used in the study. For example, it does not specify the software versions, hardware specifications, or any other tools that were used.\n",
       "  - **Step-by-Step Protocols**: The method section does not provide clear step-by-step protocols for the experiments or analyses. The order of the steps is not logical, and it is unclear how the different stages of the methodology are connected.\n",
       "  - **Ambiguities Identified**: Several ambiguous terms and vague descriptions were identified, such as \"all of the resolved SARS CoV2 crystal structures\" (which specific structures were used?), \"binding sites found on SARS CoV2 proteins\" (how were these sites identified?), and \"docking was used to confirm the results\" (what specific docking protocol was used?)."

       "\n",
       "- **Visual clarity:** The 3D representation makes it easy to grasp the spatial relationship between the molecules and the protein.\n",
       "- **Color scheme:** The use of color differentiates atoms and functional groups, aiding understanding of the chemical environment.\n",
       "- **Organization:** The figure layout is clear and facilitates comparison of interactions across different compounds.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Areas for Improvement:**\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Annotations:**  Adding annotations to identify key amino acid residues and/or specific interaction types (e.g., hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions) would greatly enhance the figure's informative value.\n",
       "- **Quantitative data:**  Including quantitative measures such as distances between interacting groups or binding affinities would provide a more complete picture of the interactions.\n",
       "- **Legend:** Providing a legend explaining the color coding for atoms and functional groups would improve accessibility.\n",
